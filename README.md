# **UCB FinTech Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge**
# *Loan Qualifier*
## Introduction

    The Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge - Loan Qualifier consists of a modular solution to solve for a loan application and loan evaluation scenario. 
    The loan officer (the user) uses the solution to capture customer provided financial data, calculate additional financial parameters for loan evaluation (e.g.ratios) and then, out of a predetermined list of lenders and their criteria, find the ones that match customer's financial parameters. This qualification process results in a list of qualified loans, which the loans officer has the option to save to a csv file and to a location of their choice.

## Goals and Objectives

    The objective is to provide a programatic solution (the application) that allows the automation of the loan qualification process by:

    1. Providing dynamic data entry capabilities (e.g not from a static list or as predetermined values), 
    2. Automate calculation of relevant ratios (Income ratio and Loan-to-Value) to complete the customer financial data set
    3. Automated filtering of qualified loans, comparing the customer fiancial data set versus the list of lender criteria (e.g. the daily rate sheet) and prepare a list of these qualified loan options
    4. And finally, provide the loans officer with the option to save the list of qualified options to a fiel and folder of his choice

#### These four main areas described above are described in detailed in the [User Stories](https://github.com/LUTOV001/2.Loan-Qualifyer/blob/main/2.Loan_Qualifyer_user_stories.txt), along with their Pass criteria
